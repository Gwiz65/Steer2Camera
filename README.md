# Steer2Camera
A mod for Wurm Unlimited Client that steers mounts, vehicles and boats towards the camera.
- needs Ago's Client Modlauncher installed.
- extract steer2camera-x.x.zip into Wurm Unlimited WurmLauncher directory.

- Steer2Camera features:
  - Works similar to Wurm Online's Steer to Camera option.
  - Will turn mount/vehicle/boat only when moving fowards, backwards or when autorun is engaged.
  - NOTE: This mod will automatically disable the game option "Rotate Player w/ Mount" because it's counterintuitive.

- Console Commands
  - s2c on      - enables Steer2Camera (default)
  - s2c off     - disables Steer2Camera
  - s2c toggle  - toggles Steer2Camera on/off
